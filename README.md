# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the School District Analysis
### Purpose of analysis
For this project I was challenged with analyzing data from multiple different schools in a district. I was tasked with creating code that would show key metrics for the district itself and for each individual school. Then analyze based on budget per student, size of the school, amd the type of school. I was then tasked with redoing this after deleting 9th grade data for a certain school based on possible academic dishonesty and to see how that affected the analysis of the data.
## Results
* After removing the 9th grade data the district summary saw a small drop in most data points, by a range of .1% to .3%. 
* The school summary saw Thomas High School see a small drop in percent passing math and reading and overall passing %. However this drop, was very insignificant mainly a .1% drop.
* By removing the 9th grader data it did not significantly impact Thomas High School's performance in comparison to other schools. As mentioned above there was insignificant amount of change to the 3 key metrics for the high school to a big difference between the schools.
# How Removing 9th Grad Scores Affected The Following:
* Math and reading scores by grade: The big change for this was that Thomas High school had a 0/nan value in the 9th grade scores for both reading and math
* Scores by school spending: Had no impact on the scores for the spending bin that Thomas high was in, or at least such a small impact it is almost unnoticeable.
* By school size: Like before it seems the small changes in percentages had little to no affect on the analysis.
* By school type: Little to no affect
## Summary
As stated above it seemed that with the now updated school district analysis the changes were so small and insignificant it barely affected any parts of the analysis. The first major thing was that for scores by grade thomas high school had nan for the 9th grade. A second change was that Thomas High saw a small decrease in most of its metrics, % passing and average scores, but since the change was a measley .1% it did not affect the analysis at all. A third change was that it changed every metric, except average reading score, in the district summary by aroun .1% and slightly higher. Finally  another change that occured was that the data based on spending changed by a small amount as well wich did not affect the output at all. Based on this I would say that there was most likely no academic dishonesty or at least if there was it had no major affect on the district data.
